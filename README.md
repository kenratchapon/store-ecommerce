## Learning Highlights

During the process of creating this project, I gained valuable insights into several key areas:

2. **CSS Styling Libraries:** The project introduced me to the utilization of CSS libraries such as Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS for designing and styling the user interface.

3. **MySQL Database Management:** I acquired a foundational understanding of working with MySQL databases. The project incorporated the use of PrismaDB as a database management tool.

4. **Authentication Implementation:** The tutorial comprehensively explained the process of implementing authentication using Clerk Authentication. This allowed me to establish secure user authentication within the application.
